## This is my OOP research (Object-Oriented Programming)

Object oriented programming is a complex theory and might take some more work to fully appreciate.
To enable more learning, research some different sources and consolidate the descriptions of what OOP means in different contexts.
Try to find other analogies like the “cookie cutter” or the “car” that might encourage a light bulb moment.
Compare your findings in your dev teams - if you had to describe OOP in a few words, what would you say?

Encapsulation

Abstraction

Inheritence

Polymorphism
